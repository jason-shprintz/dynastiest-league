    title: "8. Unsportsmanlike Conduct",
    content: `The following actions are prohibited: collusion, not setting lineups, and any behavior detrimental to the league. Violations, depending on severity, will include, but are not limited to, a warning, loss of draft picks, or expulsion from the league.
      
      1) Under no circumstances shall league members engage in collusion to gain an unfair advantage. Collusion includes, but is not limited to, conspiring with other league members to manipulate trades, matchups, or draft positions. If collusion is suspected, the league commissioner will investigate and determine appropriate action.

      2) All league members are required to set their lineups each week. Failure to set a lineup may result in a warning for the first offense. Repeated failure to set lineups may lead to loss of draft picks or other penalties as determined by the commissioner.
      
      (NOTE: If someone starts a player that was injured or out for the week due to illness or coaches' decision, that is NOT considered unsportsmanlike conduct. It is the manager's responsibility to stay informed about player statuses, but mistakes happen and are understandable. This applies only to genuine oversights, not intentional negligence.)

      (ADDITIONAL NOTE: The league will not police lineup decisions. A manager has the right to start any player on their roster, regardless of projected performance. As long as the player is active and eligible to play, the manager may choose to start them without penalty.)

      3) Any behavior deemed detrimental to the league, including but not limited to harassment, offensive language, or disruptive conduct during league communications or events, will not be tolerated. The commissioner reserves the right to issue warnings or expel members from the league based on the severity of the conduct. General smack talk is allowed and encouraged, provided it remains in good spirit and does not cross the line into unsportsmanlike behavior. Unsportsmanlike conduct includes, but is not limited to, racist comments, invoking family members in a derogatory manner, or any other form of communication that is intended to demean or insult another league member.

      All league members are expected to uphold the integrity and spirit of fair competition within the Dynastiest League. The commissioner will enforce these rules to ensure a positive and enjoyable experience for all participants. If any league member has concerns or questions regarding these policies, they are encouraged to discuss them with the commissioner.

      In the unlikely and also unfortunate instance where a league member is expelled from the league mid season due to unsportsmanlike conduct, the commissioner will set the team's lineup based solely on projected points until a suitable replacement manager is found.

    League members are not required to participate in the chat but are encouraged to stay engaged with league activities and discussions.

    Important announcements will also be announced in the Sleeper app to ensure all members are informed, regardless of their participation in the chat.

    All league members are expected to maintain a respectful and sportsmanlike tone in all communications within the chat. Any violations of the Unsportsmanlike Conduct policy will be addressed by the commissioner as outlined in Section 8.
